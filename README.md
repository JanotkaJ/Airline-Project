# Airline Project
Do not use any of the source code to submit as your own work or idea

## Overview
This project simulated a fake airline company by using txt files containing data pertaining to distance between specific flights and the costs associated with them. Upon reading in the txt file, the user has several options such as viewing all of the routes in graph form, computing shortest paths based on distance, price, and layovers, computing trips under a total budget, and adjusting routes as needed. This project used two data structures, Digraph and Iterable as well as two graphing algorithms, Breadth First Search and Dijkstras to perform the above tasks.
